# Automated-Scam-Reporter

![Spam Banned Icon](https://github.com/AngelLozan/Automated-Scam-Reporter/blob/main/client/src/ban.png?raw=true)

Example stages. 

So far, the app will take a url for a scam google form (or any) and send it to the server where a puppeteer script runs, opens a browser instance and reports the form as a scam. 

App: https://scamreporterfront.onrender.com/

Server: https://autoreporter.onrender.com/

- `/api/ready` is an additional GET request you can test on the server.
